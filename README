This is ttk, a GUI (and other stuff) toolkit for the iPod.

Overview
--------
See API.txt for a (possibly slightly out-of-date) description of
the API.

The core library is complete, except for the COP functions.
An SDL interface is done.
A Microwindows interface is in the works.
Widgets still need to be written and are being worked on now.

For an example program, see src/exscroll.c. It's automatically
compiled with the rest of the library.

To compile the library, just type `make'. To install it,
`sudo make install'. To compile the examples, `make examples'.

In order to run exscroll on your iPod, you'll need to copy
the binary to /mnt/ipod/bin/ and copy the `fonts/' directory
in this archive to /mnt/ipod/usr/share/fonts. The fonts.lst
format is like the one used by Podzilla's font.lst, except
that the [filename] field is missing the extension. (This allows
different fonts to be used for different iPods, e.g. using an
anti-aliased font on the Photo). This small difference is the
reason for the slight name change.

Four versions of the library are built: ipod-sdl, ipod-mwin,
x11-sdl, x11-mwin. Be sure to link with the appropriate one.

Compilation
-----------
Use the output of
`ttk-config --[ipod|x11] --[mwin|sdl] --[cflags|libs|(both)]`.
Most necessary libraries are linked into libttk on the iPod.

exscroll
--------
exscroll is a quickie demo program for TTK. The interface
consists of two numbers. I'll call them #1 (top) and #2 (bottom).

 * Scrolling left or right changes #1 by that amount.
 * Tapping the scroll wheel sets #2 to that position.
 * << or >> decreases or increases (resp.) #1 by 10.
 * Menu exits.
 * Play resets #1 and #2 to 0.
 * Action sets #2 to 100.
 * #2 is reset to 0 every three seconds.

This demonstrates most of the base functionality of the TTK GUI.
Widgets can respond to all of this.

A few heuristics are used to avoid counting scrolling or button
pressing as a scrollwheel tap or vice versa, but the cost of this
is that scrollwheel taps cannot be detected until you take your
finger off the wheel.

Have a lot of fun!
